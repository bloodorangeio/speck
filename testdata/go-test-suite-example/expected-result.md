# Example Go Test Suite

## Intro

This is everything you need to know.

Here is a fancy code snippet for you:

```
console.log("woo");
```

## Tests

### Test 1

In this test we will ensure that the number one (1) is indeed equal to itself.

You would think this could never go wrong, but *oh* you would be surprised.

Have you ever watched Sesame Street? Great show.

```
                       \WWW/
                       /   \
                      /wwwww\
                    _|  o_o  |_
       \WWWWWWW/   (_   / \   _)
     _.'` o_o `'._   |  \_/  |
    (_    (_)    _)  : ~~~~~ :
      '.'-...-'.'     \_____/
       (`'---'`)      [     ]
jgs     `"""""`       `"""""`
```

#### Possible Failures

In rare cases, the number one (1) might equal something else, in which case
you are encouraged to use a different programming language entirely.

### Test 2

In this test we will ensure that the letter "a" is indeed equal to itself.

#### Possible Failures

In rare cases, the letter "a" might equal something else, in which case
you may want to question the entire existence of the universe.
